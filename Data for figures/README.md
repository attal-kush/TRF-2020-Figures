# TRF-2020-Figures - Creating Binary Activity Files

This repository contains the raw data and Python scripts needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **Time-Restricted Feeding in the Active Phase Drives Periods of Rapid Food Consumption in Rats Fed a High-Fat, High-Sugar Diet with Liquid Sucrose**

To recreate the binary ZIP archives for feeding and sucrose drinking activity, follow 3 steps:
1. Download this entire repository into any local directory (if not done already)
2. These scripts were created using [Python version **3.8.6**](https://www.python.org/downloads/), so **ensure Python version 3.8.6 (or newer) is installed.** Then, use *requirements.txt* to download the proper versions of all libraries needed to run the scripts. 
3. Run *Creating_Binary_CSV_Files.py* without making any changes to source code. ZIP files - labeled "Feeding_Binary_CSV_Files.zip" and "Sucrose_Binary_CSV_Files.zip" will be located in the current folder "Data for Figures".
