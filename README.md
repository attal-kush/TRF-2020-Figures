# TRF-2020-Figures

This repository contains the raw data and Python scripts needed to reproduce all the figures from the manuscript: **Time-Restricted Feeding in the Active Phase Drives Periods of Rapid Food Consumption in Rats Fed a High-Fat, High-Sugar Diet with Liquid Sucrose**

Raw video data is located in "Data for Figures", and the Jupyter Notebook Python scripts *Feeding_Activity_Creating_CSV_Files.ipynb* and *Sucrose_Activity_Creating_CSV_Files.ipynb* create the binary feeding and sucrose excel sheets from raw video data, respectively. 
Each figure folder contains a "Making Figures" folder that contains the script to recreate the .tiff file and a "Statistical Analysis" folder.
