# TRF-2020-Figures

This repository contains the raw data and Python scripts needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **Time-Restricted Feeding in the Active Phase Drives Periods of Rapid Food Consumption in Rats Fed a High-Fat, High-Sugar Diet with Liquid Sucrose**

**To generate all figures from the manuscript, follow these steps:**
1. Download this entire repository into any local directory
2. These scripts were created using [Python version **3.8.6**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/), so **ensure Python version 3.8.6 is installed.** Then, use *requirements.txt* to download the proper versions of all libraries needed to run the scripts. 
3. Run *figures_and_analysis.py* without making any changes to source code. Results will be located in a newly-created directory labeled *Figures_And_Analysis*, which itself will be created inside this folder *TRF-2020-Figures*

Raw video data and ZIP archives for feeding and sucrose binary activity are located in *Data for Figures*. To recreate the ZIP archives for feeding and sucrose binary activity, check the **README** located in the folder *Data for Figures*.
