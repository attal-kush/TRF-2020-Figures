# TRF-2020-Figures

This repository contains the raw data and Python scripts needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **Time-Restricted Feeding in the Active Phase Drives Periods of Rapid Food Consumption in Rats Fed a High-Fat, High-Sugar Diet with Liquid Sucrose**

To reproduce figures 3, 4, and 5 from the manuscript, follow 2 steps:
1. Use the *requirements.txt* file to download the proper versions of all libraries needed to run the scripts. The scripts were created using Python version **3.8.6**, so **ensure Python version 3.8.6 (or newer) is installed**
2. Run the *figures_and_analysis.py* file

Raw video data is located in "Data for Figures". To recreate the binary ZIP archives for feeding and sucrose activity, run the *Creating_Binary_CSV_Files.py* file with the proper libraries and Python version from Step 1
